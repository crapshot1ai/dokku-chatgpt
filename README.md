# A simple chatbot using the gpt-3.5-turbo model deployed with Dokku

very simple: PHP | CSS | html | Javascript

based on 
(1) https://github.com/rueetschli/OpenAI-GPT-3.5-turbo-simple-script which was forked from 
(2) https://github.com/dirk1983/chatgpt 

Source (1) was translated to English and an input field was added to query for OpenAI API Key instead of saving key in script on server. Added empty composer.json for deployment with dokku.

All files needed for deployment and running the chatbot are contained in this repository. Instead of deployment with dokku all files can also be copied to (protected) web directory.

To run use the chatbot: Register at https://platform.openai.com/ for an API key.
